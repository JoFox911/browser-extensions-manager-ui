In this project, I focused on building a scalable and well-structured frontend architecture using Vue 3 and Vite. I practiced a number of modern frontend development techniques and tools, including:

âœ… State management with Pinia, using stores with actions, getters, and filtering logic to manage application data in a clean and modular way.

ðŸ§± Project architecture designed for scalability, with reusable components, a layout system, and routing structure that supports adding new pages, dynamic views, and route guards.

ðŸŽ¨ Theme switching (light/dark) implemented via CSS variables and a centralized Pinia store, with persistence using localStorage and support for system preferences.

ðŸ–‹ Typography with Variable Fonts, using font-weight ranges and clean @font-face integration to improve performance and design flexibility.

â™¿ Focused on accessibility and semantic HTML, including proper use of ARIA attributes and keyboard-friendly components.

ðŸš€ Automated deployment to GitHub Pages, using GitHub Actions for continuous deployment, dynamic base path configuration via Vite, and branch-based publishing with peaceiris/actions-gh-pages.

Overall, this project helped me strengthen my skills in building adaptable, maintainable, and modern Vue applications with a clean design system and automated deployment pipeline.
